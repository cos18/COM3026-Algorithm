definition of check(s, e, ct)
    if s is e
        checktime[s] = checktime[s] + 1
        return
    let mid = (s+e)/2 -> it must be integer (round down the float value)
    check(s, mid, ct)
    check(mid+1, e, ct)

input the number of people (let's say p)
for i in (list of numbers from 0 to p-1)
    first, input the date (it can be "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI")
    then input the timetable string (form of xxxx-xxxx) until newline come
    change the timetable string to timestamp in 5 minute cut (ex. 0900 -> 0, 1030 -> 18, 2100 -> 144)
    save timestamp by pair(start, end) at list (let's say t[i])

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    make list contains 145 zeros (let's say c)
    for every person
        for ts in t[]
            check(ts.first, ts.second, c)

    let start = -1
    let g is list
    for j in (list of numbers from 0 to 144)
        if start is -1 and c[j] is 0
            start = 0 if (j is 0) or j-1
        if start is not -1 and c[j]>0
            if j-start>=6
                append start and j pair in g
            start = -1
    if start is -1 and 144-start>=6
        append start and 144 pair in g

    if g is not empty
        first print day of the week according to i (ex. 0->MON, 2->WED)
        for gg in g
            print timestamp according to gg (ex. pair of 0, 12 -> print 0900-1000)
        print newline
